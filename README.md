# EpiPlume

Exploratory models of pathogen movement via aerosol, particle, and airborne dispersion.

## Table of Contents:

1.  [Simple Gaussian Plume](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/gaussian_plume.md): Model for Continuous emissions from a point source in a steady-state wind field, assuming Gaussian distribution of concentrations in the horizontal and vertical directions.  
2.  [Particle Trajectories](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/hysplit_trajectory.md): Simulate paths for individual particles.    
3.  [Dynamic Plume](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/hysplit_plume.md): Simulated 36 hour plume dispersion resulting from massive emission event.   
4.  [SpatioTemporal Smoothing](https://github.com/geoepi/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/smooth_plume.md): Build spatiotemporal model from plume output.  
5.  [Poultry SEIR and Shedding](https://github.com/geoepi/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/poultry_seir.md): SEIR model to estimate virus poultry emissions.
