# EpiPlume

Exploratory models of pathogen movement via aerosol, particle, and airborne dispersion.

## Conceptual Overview
1.  [HPAI Plume Modeling](https://geoepi.github.io/EpiPlume/): This webpage includes a demonstrative workflow, with one tab showing a forward in time [Outbreak Simulation](https://geoepi.github.io/EpiPlume/simulate_outbreak.html) and a second tab [Back Tracing](https://geoepi.github.io/EpiPlume/trace_emission_source.html) an outbreak to an emission source.  
  

## Other Repo Contents:
1.  [Simple Gaussian Plume](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/gaussian_plume.md): Model for Continuous emissions from a point source in a steady-state wind field, assuming Gaussian distribution of concentrations in the horizontal and vertical directions.  
2.  [Particle Trajectories](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/hysplit_trajectory.md): Simulate paths for individual particles.    
3.  [Dynamic Plume](https://github.com/JMHumphreys/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/hysplit_plume.md): Simulated 36 hour plume dispersion resulting from massive emission event.   
4.  [SpatioTemporal Smoothing](https://github.com/geoepi/EpiPlume/blob/main/docs/smooth_plume.md): Build spatiotemporal model from plume output.
